<p>
Hi human, <br />
I'm Mr.Pose! :robot: :wave: <br />
I help to estimate and measure exercises for humans. Lets do some exercise and keep the body fit. :muscle: :mechanical_arm:
</p>

## Description :scroll:

Exercises, in general, helps to maintain a physically fit body, loosen up joints, and relax muscles.

Mr.Pose is a visual analytics application that helps humans to track the accuracy of exercise, and count reps or to predict the exercise. <br />

Mr.Pose can support <br />
* Pushup
* Plank
* Squat
* JumpingJack

For Pushup, Plank and JumpingJack, Mr.Pose will track each repetition provided that the exercise is accurately performed.
For Plank, Mr.Pose will track the time of plank position.

## General Requirements :mage_man:
1. Record a video of person doing a supported exercise.
2. Place the camera horizontally facing the person performing exercise (preferably at eye level).
3. Higher the resolution of video, higher the quality of estimation and measurement.

## Code Requirements :mage_woman:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run :running_man:
```python
python mrpose.py --video <path to video file> --exercise <exercise to be measured>
```
Note:<br />

*<path to video file\>* - Path to the input video file with supported exercise<br />
*<exercise to be measured\>* - Exercise in input video file<br />

**Optional Argument:**<br />
*--video* - Path to video source file. <br />
If argument is not provided, then Mr.Pose will launch webcam for live video. Currently, live webcam video works only for exercise prediction. <br />
*--exercise* - Choices are pushup, plank, squat, jumpingjack <br />
If argument is not provided, then Mr.Pose will **predict** the exercise done in the video. If argument is provided, then Mr.Pose will measure the exercise mentioned.
