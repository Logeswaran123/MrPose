Hi human, <br>
I'm Mr.Pose! :robot: :wave: <br>
I help to estimate and measure exercises for humans. Lets do some exercise and keep the body fit. :muscle: :mechanical_arm:
</p>

## Description :scroll:

Exercises, in general, helps to maintain a physically fit body, loosen up joints, and relax muscles.

Mr.Pose is a visual analytics application that helps humans to track the accuracy of exercise, and count reps. <br>

Mr.Pose can support <br>
* Pushup
* Plank
* Squat
* JumpingJack

For Pushup, Plank and JumpingJack, Mr.Pose will track each repetition provided that the exercise is accurately performed.
For Plank, Mr.Pose will track the time of plank position.

## General Requirements :mage_man:
1. Record a video of person doing a supported exercise.
2. Place the camera horizontally facing the person performing exercise (preferably at eye level).
3. Higher the resolution of video, higher the quality of estimation and measurement.
